# Enumeration & Reconnaissance

A collection of penetration testing projects focused on information gathering, host discovery, and service enumeration techniques. This repository demonstrates practical reconnaissance methodologies used in professional security assessments.

## üéØ Repository Overview

This repository covers Phase 2, Intelligence Gathering, of the PTES framework.

**Enumeration and Reconnaissance**. Each project includes detailed documentation, scripts, and real-world lab implementations demonstrating both passive and active information gathering techniques.

## üìö Projects & Labs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations

**CRITICAL**: All reconnaissance activities documented here are performed in:

- Controlled lab environments
- Authorized testing scenarios
- Educational contexts with proper permission

**Unauthorized reconnaissance of networks or systems you do not own is illegal**

Always obtain **explicit written authorization** before conducting any security testing.
